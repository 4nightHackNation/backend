Radar Legislacyjny is an interactive platform for tracking legislative processes with a built-in public consultation system. The platform enables citizens, government officers, and administrators to monitor, participate in, and manage legislative acts from initiation to enactment.

The project provides full transparency of the legislative process, allowing users to:

Track legal changes from pre-consultations to publication in the Journal of Laws
Participate in public consultations and influence the shape of law
Understand the impact of regulations on citizens, businesses, and public administration
Manage legislative projects and officer accounts (for administrators)
